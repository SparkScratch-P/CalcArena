   CalcArena is here with the varied new collection of Awesome **Calculators** , that were often needed, but not available on the web! 
   
   **CalcArena** is an innitiative of [SparkScratch-P](https://sparkscratch-p.github.io/) , and is lisenced under [GNU General Public Lisense v3.0](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/CalcArena/blob/main/LICENSE) (Open-Source).

## The Awesome Collection of Calculators : 

### [Quadratic Polynomial Calculator -](https://sparkscratch-p.github.io/CalcArena/quadratic-polynomials/)

 This is an exciting two face calculator for Evaluating sums of the **Quadratic Polynomials**. This has two calculators in it : One that derives the zeros, or *roots of the polynomial* (quadratic only) and the other, can make out *the polynomial* with just the values of zeros given!!! The given polynomial must be quadratic , i.e, *the numeric coefficient of x^2 must be non-zero.* It solves the zeros by **Sreedharacharya's method**, and fins polynomials with the equations ; *x^2-(α+β)x+(αβ)=0*

### [Roation Wheel Speed Calculator-](https://sparkscratch-p.github.io/CalcArena/rotation-wheel-speed/) <BETA>
 
  Mainly applicable for robots, arduino, rasp or ther electronic cars, and even vehicles. This calculator find the speed generated by the rotation of wheels in terms of m/s with respect to rotation per minute, and the size of the wheel. The Algothims undergoes the fact that the distance covered by the wheel in one second is *the product of the number of times it experiences one complete rotation with the length it covers in one single rotation.* The value may be different from real life in cases the rotation speed varies, or the exact RPM reduces due to *loss of mechanical efficiency*.
